### Description

- Exploration of the effects of online personal attacks on victims' activity on social media (Reddit).

-   First large-scale (150K users who generated more than 180K comments), behavioral analysis that uses a high-precision Artificial Intelligence system and is not based on self-reported data.

-  Data analysis in R conducted from three perspectives: (1)~classical statistical methods, (2)~Bayesian estimation, and (3)~model-theoretic analysis with hurdle and zero-inflated models.

-  Personal attacks received online significantly decrease victims' online activity.
