Exploration of the effects of online personal attacks on victims' activity on social media (Reddit). It's the first large-scale (150K users who generated more than 180K comments), behavioral analysis that uses a high-precision Artificial Intelligence system and is not based on self-reported data.
The data analysis has been conducted in R from three perspectives: (1)~classical statistical methods, (2)~Bayesian estimation, and (3)~model-theoretic analysis with hurdle and zero-inflated models. The key observation: personal attacks received online significantly decrease victims' online activity.
